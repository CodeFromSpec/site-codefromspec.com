# Code from Spec — Rationale

Code from Spec is not a methodology for writing code
with AI. It is a methodology for changing how
organizations build software. The disruption is not
in the coding — it is in who participates, how
knowledge flows, and where accountability lives. AI
is the enabler, not the point.

## The problem software has always had

Software is written by people who hold context in their
heads. The engineer receives requirements, translates them
into code, and in that translation makes hundreds of small
decisions that are never recorded anywhere. When the
engineer leaves, the decisions leave too. What remains is
code that works — until it doesn't — and that nobody fully
understands anymore.

This is not a failure of discipline. It is a structural
problem. Code is not a good medium for expressing intent.
It expresses mechanism. You can read code and understand
what it does; you cannot read it and understand why it
does that, what alternatives were considered, or what
constraints it is silently respecting.

The industry built compensating mechanisms: comments,
wikis, ADRs, runbooks, onboarding docs. None of them
work at scale because they are separate from the system.
They describe a system that exists independently. As the
system changes, they drift. Eventually they describe a
system that no longer exists, and the team stops trusting
them. The knowledge returns to people's heads, and the
cycle repeats.

Software doesn't collapse when it's wrong — it silently
misbehaves. That is why the industry got away with this
for so long. The cost was always there: in bugs, in
rework, in systems nobody dares to change because nobody
understands them anymore.

---

## The translation problem

Every organization that builds software has two kinds of
knowledge: domain knowledge and technical knowledge.
Domain knowledge lives in the people who understand the
business — compliance officers who know the regulations,
legal teams who know the contracts, infosec teams who
know the threat model, product managers who know the user
needs. Technical knowledge lives in the engineers who
know how to build systems.

Traditionally, the engineer was the only author of
software. They received domain knowledge as requirements
— documents, meetings, conversations — and translated
it into code.
This translation was lossy. Every handoff lost
information. Every interpretation introduced error. The more
intermediaries between the domain expert and the code,
the more the implementation drifted from the original
intent.

The result was systems that worked technically but
implemented the domain approximately. Compliance rules
that were almost right. Business logic that handled the
common case but missed the edge case that the domain
expert knew about but never thought to mention because
they assumed the engineer would understand.

This was not a failure of individual engineers. It was
the inevitable consequence of a process where domain
knowledge had to pass through a single narrow channel —
the engineer's interpretation — before becoming software.

---

## What the 1980s understood and abandoned

The software engineering community recognized this
problem decades ago. Structured analysis, stepwise
refinement, formal specifications — the 1970s and 1980s
produced rigorous methods for capturing domain knowledge
before writing code. The goal was exactly what we
describe here: a structured artifact that expressed
intent, could be reviewed by domain experts, and guided
implementation.

The methods failed not because they were wrong but
because they were expensive. Maintaining a specification
in sync with evolving code required constant manual
effort. The spec drifted. The team stopped trusting it.
The cost of maintaining the spec exceeded the cost of
fixing the bugs it would have prevented.

The industry responded with agility: shorter cycles,
working software over documentation, embrace change.
This was a rational response to a real constraint. If
specifications cannot be kept current, don't maintain
them — get feedback faster instead.

But the constraint was economic, not fundamental. The
industry didn't abandon specifications because they were
wrong. It abandoned them because the cost of keeping
them current was too high.

---

## The programmer bottleneck

The software industry has always known that the
bottleneck is not typing code — it is understanding
what to build. The response was to split the role:
analysts who understood the domain, and programmers
who wrote the code. The analyst captured requirements;
the programmer implemented them. This was the
formalization of the translation problem, not its
solution. It added a handoff instead of removing one.

The cost of producing programmers is enormous. Years
of formal education, years of practical experience,
continuous learning as platforms and languages evolve.
And the output of this investment is a person who
translates — who takes someone else's understanding
and re-expresses it in a language machines can execute.
The domain expert cannot do this. The programmer
cannot fully understand the domain. The gap between
them is where bugs live.

The industry tried to close this gap from multiple
directions. No-code and low-code platforms attempted to
let non-programmers build software directly. Visual
tools, domain-specific languages, spreadsheet-based
systems — all tried to remove the programmer from the
loop. They succeeded for narrow cases: simple
workflows, forms, dashboards. They failed for anything
complex enough to require real engineering judgment:
error handling, concurrency, security, integration
with other systems.

The fundamental issue persisted: someone had to
translate domain knowledge into something executable.
The programmer remained indispensable — expensive to
train, scarce in supply, and the sole bridge between
what the organization knew and what the software did.

---

## Agile: what it solved and what it conceded

Agile, lean, and continuous delivery solved real
problems that go far beyond specifications: fast
feedback loops, incremental delivery, prioritization
under uncertainty, responsiveness to change. These
remain valuable. Code from Spec does not replace them.

But agile's greatest contribution may have been
subtler than feedback loops or incremental delivery.
By prioritizing working software over comprehensive
documentation, agile removed a bottleneck that formal
methods had created: the separation between "people
who specify" and "people who code." Agile trusted the
programmer to make domain decisions at the point of
implementation — to talk directly to the user, to
understand the business context, to specify and build
in the same motion. This democratized authorship in
a way that the 1980s never achieved. The programmer
was no longer waiting for a spec — they were
empowered to figure it out.

Agile compensated for the risk with short cycles.
When the programmer made a wrong domain decision, the
delivery cycle was short enough that the user saw the
result quickly and corrected it. This worked as
implicit domain feedback — not a spec review, but
"I saw it running, that's wrong, fix it." The error
still had to be made, implemented, delivered, and
discovered — but at least the discovery was fast.

This worked well when the end user was the domain
expert. It worked less well for domains where the
person who sees the demo is not the person who knows
the rules. A product demo shows screens and flows —
it does not show that the provisioning calculation
uses the wrong cutoff date, or that the settlement
logic violates a regulatory constraint. The
compliance officer, the accountant, the legal
analyst — they are not in the demo. Or if they are,
they cannot tell from a demo whether the underlying
logic is correct.

This creates a dynamic similar to the market for
lemons: when the people who hold domain knowledge
cannot evaluate the quality of the implementation,
quality degrades. An engineering team that implements
the domain rules precisely is indistinguishable —
from the stakeholder's perspective — from one that
implements them approximately. Both pass the demo.
Both look correct on the surface. The difference
surfaces months later, in a failed audit, a
reconciliation that doesn't balance, a regulatory
finding. By then, the cost of correction is orders
of magnitude higher — and the team that cut corners
has long since moved on to the next sprint.

This is a fundamental problem in software, not a
failure of agile specifically. The developer who
spends time getting edge cases right, validating
with domain experts, handling errors precisely —
delivers more slowly. The one who cuts corners
delivers faster and receives praise. The quality
that matters is invisible in the short term: it
manifests only as the absence of problems, which
no one notices. When the damage surfaces months or
years later — a failed audit, a silent data
corruption, a compliance violation — no one
remembers who wrote the code or what shortcuts were
taken. The incentive structure rewards speed over
correctness, because correctness is unobservable at
the point of delivery.

Agile solved the bottleneck by removing the spec.
The knowledge that would have been in the spec
became invisible — encoded in code that only the
programmer could read. When the programmer left,
the knowledge left too.

Code from Spec changes this by making quality
observable. The spec tree is an artifact that domain
experts can read and evaluate. When the compliance
officer reviews a spec node, they can tell whether
the rules are right — before any code is generated.
The asymmetry of information that degraded quality
disappears. The developer who gets the domain right
is visibly different from the one who approximates,
because the spec makes the difference legible to the
people who know. The incentive realigns: correctness
is no longer invisible, and shortcuts are no longer
undetectable.

---

## AI changes the economics

AI inverts the cost structure. Code generation is now
cheap. An agent can implement a well-specified component
in seconds. The scarce resource is no longer writing the
code — it is knowing what to write.

More importantly: when code is generated from spec,
synchronization is automatic by construction. The spec
does not drift from the code because the code is derived
from the spec. There is no separate maintenance burden.
The argument that killed formal specification in the
1980s no longer applies.

This is not a marginal improvement. It is the removal of
the constraint that made formal specifications
impractical for forty years.

Code from Spec restores what agile conceded — without
reintroducing the bottleneck. The spec tree provides
the structured specification that formal methods
promised, kept current by construction because code
is derived from it. But unlike the 1980s, authorship
is not restricted to a special role. Everyone
contributes — just as agile intended — but the
contributions are recorded in the tree, not lost in
the code.

The short cycles, incremental delivery, and feedback
loops of agile remain — but now each iteration
produces a spec change and a regeneration, not an
ad-hoc code change that drifts from an outdated
document.

The two are complementary. Agile provides the process.
Code from Spec provides the artifact.

---

## Why AI-generated code can be trusted

AI is not infallible. Agents hallucinate. They produce
code that looks correct but isn't. A methodology that
depends on AI-generated code must acknowledge this and
compensate for it.

Code from Spec compensates through structure:

**Small scope.** Each leaf node generates a small,
focused piece of code — a single handler, a single
type file, a single error constant. The agent is not
asked to generate an entire system. It is asked to
generate one thing, with complete context. Small scope
means smaller surface area for hallucination.

**Complete context.** The agent reads the full chain
from root to leaf before generating. Every constraint
from every ancestor is present. The agent does not
guess what the security rules are or what the error
format looks like — it reads them from the chain. The
more precise the chain, the less room for invention.

**Tests as guardrails.** Every leaf node has a sibling
test node. Tests are specified before code generation
— they describe the expected behavior, not the
implementation. The generated code must pass these
tests. If the agent hallucinates, the tests catch it.

**Build and test verification.** Every resync ends
with `build + test`. If the generated code doesn't
compile or doesn't pass tests, the spec is traced
back and corrected. The agent does not get the last
word — the tests do.

This is not blind trust in AI. It is a framework that
uses AI's strengths (fast generation from precise
context) while compensating for its weaknesses
(hallucination, inconsistency) with structural
guardrails.

---

## Tests as accumulated knowledge

In traditional development, tests are written alongside
code and change with it. They are implementation
artifacts — when the code is rewritten, the tests are
rewritten too. Knowledge encoded in test cases is lost
and rediscovered with each rewrite.

Code from Spec treats tests differently. Test nodes are
sibling specs that describe *what to verify*, not *how
to implement*. But the generated test code often
contains know-how that goes beyond the spec: specific
values that triggered a production bug, sequences that
exposed a race condition, assertions that catch subtle
regressions.

This know-how accumulates. Every bug found in
production adds a scenario to the test node. Every
edge case discovered adds a verification. The test
file grows monotonically — it is a living record of
everything the system has learned about its own
failure modes.

Because of this, test files are treated with more care
than implementation files during regeneration. Before
rewriting a test file, the agent must verify that
everything currently tested would be reconstructed
with good precision. If test knowledge exists in code
but not in the test spec, it must be migrated to the
spec first — otherwise regeneration destroys learning.

This migration is real work, and it is easy to neglect.
In practice, each regeneration of a test file produces
different code — different helper functions, different
variable names, different assertion structures. If a
production bug was caught by a specific assertion that
exists in the test code but not in the test spec, that
assertion disappears on regeneration. The immune system
forgets.

The discipline required is: before regenerating a test
file, review it for knowledge that lives only in code.
Migrate that knowledge to the test spec. Then
regenerate. This is the cost of the methodology — it
is not free. But it is a one-time cost per piece of
knowledge, and over time the test spec absorbs the
know-how from the code. This is the same convergence
cycle as variability analysis for implementation code
— each iteration makes the spec more complete and the
generated output more stable.

The result is a testing framework that gets stronger
with every incident, every edge case, every production
surprise. Tests are not disposable. They are the
organization's immune system — and immune systems
must never forget. But they will forget if the team
does not actively migrate knowledge from code to spec
before each regeneration.

---

## The real work: making specs precise enough

The rationale presents spec authoring as the creative
work and code generation as the mechanical step. This is
true in principle. In practice, the creative work is
harder and more iterative than it appears.

A spec that seems clear to a human may be ambiguous to
an agent. The agent makes a reasonable implementation
choice — and it is wrong. The tests fail. The team
diagnoses, discovers the ambiguity, adds a constraint
to the spec, and regenerates. The new code has a
different problem. Another constraint is added. Another
regeneration. A single leaf node may go through ten or
more iterations before the spec is precise enough to
reliably produce correct code.

This iteration is not a failure of the methodology. It
is the methodology working. Each iteration makes the
spec more precise, the generated code more predictable,
and the team's understanding of the domain more
explicit. The knowledge that was implicit — "obviously
you'd use forward slashes," "obviously you'd skip
directories" — becomes explicit in the spec. That
explicit knowledge is the asset.

But teams adopting Code from Spec should budget for
this iteration. The first spec for a leaf node will not
produce correct code on the first try. The fifth
version might. The tenth version will produce correct
code reliably across regenerations. This convergence
is real and measurable, but it takes time and
attention.

The variability analysis technique — reviewing
generated code, classifying each deviation as "accept"
or "prescribe," tightening the spec accordingly — is
the structured approach to this convergence. Teams
that skip it and simply regenerate until the tests
pass are missing the point: the goal is not code that
works today, but a spec that produces correct code
every time.

---

## Software as a collaborative product

Code from Spec is not primarily a methodology for writing
code faster. It is a methodology for changing how
organizations build software — from a process owned by
engineering to a collaborative product of the entire
organization.

In traditional development, the engineer is the sole
author. Everyone else is a stakeholder who provides
input and reviews output. Compliance writes requirements
documents. Product writes user stories. Legal writes
policy memos. The engineer reads all of it, interprets
it, and produces code. The software is the engineer's
interpretation of everyone else's knowledge.

Code from Spec makes every contributor a direct author.
But — and this is the key distinction — not by making
everyone a programmer. Each contributor is a domain
expert who adds their knowledge to the spec tree:

- A **compliance officer** contributes regulatory
  constraints. They know which rules apply, what the
  penalties are, what the regulator expects.
- A **product manager** contributes business rules.
  They know how the product should behave, what the
  user needs, what the edge cases are.
- A **legal team member** contributes contract
  interpretations. They know what the agreement says
  and what it means.
- An **infosec engineer** contributes security
  constraints as guard nodes. They know the threat
  model and the countermeasures.
- A **software engineer** contributes technical
  constraints — performance requirements, concurrency
  patterns, error handling strategies, platform
  considerations. They are a domain expert too: their
  domain is software itself.

Consider a concrete example. A company is building a
credit card system — settlement, accounting,
reconciliation. In traditional development, the
engineering team builds the system and shows it to the
accounting team a week before production. The
accounting team discovers that the provisioning logic
uses the wrong base amount, that journal entries don't
follow the chart of accounts, that the reconciliation
assumes calendar days instead of business days. These
are not edge cases — they are fundamental domain
rules that the engineering team never knew, because no
one from accounting was involved when those decisions
were made.

Agile would say: involve stakeholders early, do
frequent demos. But a demo shows screens and flows —
it does not show that the system is calculating
interest on the wrong balance, or that the accrual
logic uses the wrong cutoff date. Those details live
in the code. The accounting team cannot review code.
They discover the errors when the numbers come out
wrong.

With Code from Spec, the accounting team writes — or
reviews — the spec nodes that define provisioning
rules, journal entry formats, reconciliation logic,
before a single line of code is generated. The
discussion happens over intent expressed in structured
natural language, not over implementation. The
engineer contributes the technical constraints: how
to handle concurrent settlement batches, how to
ensure idempotency, how to recover from partial
failures. Neither overwrites the other. The
accounting knowledge and the engineering knowledge
combine in the tree, and the agent produces code that
satisfies both.

This is not just early involvement — it is direct
authorship. The accounting team is not giving feedback
on someone else's work. They are contributing their
own knowledge to the spec tree, with the same
authority as the engineer. The software that results
is a product of both domains, not an engineering
interpretation of accounting requirements.

No one overwrites anyone else's contribution. The tree
is additive. The compliance officer does not need to
understand concurrency. The engineer does not need to
understand the regulation. The accounting team does
not need to understand error recovery. Each
contributes what they know, and the agent synthesizes
code that satisfies all of it simultaneously.

This is safe because the tree structure itself
provides the guardrails. Intermediate nodes define
constraints that all descendants must respect —
security policies, error handling standards,
architectural patterns. A product manager who adds a
new API endpoint cannot accidentally bypass security
requirements. The constraints are above them in the
tree. The agent reads them. The generated code
respects them. The quality mechanism is architectural,
not cultural — it does not depend on contributors
knowing the rules. But guard nodes only work when they
are precise. A vague constraint like "follow security
best practices" gives the agent room to interpret —
and its interpretation may be superficial or wrong.
Guard nodes must prescribe concrete rules: specific
error codes, required fields, authentication patterns,
timeout values. The more precise the guard, the less
room for the agent to invent.

The engineer is no longer the star of the process —
the sole translator, the bottleneck through which all
knowledge must pass. They are one expert among several,
contributing specialized knowledge that combines with
everyone else's. This is not a demotion. It is a
liberation: the engineer focuses on what they are
uniquely good at — software design — instead of
spending most of their time translating other people's
knowledge into code.

The translation does not disappear. A spec is still an
interpretation — the compliance officer's understanding
of the regulation, the product manager's model of the
user need. The lossy handoff moves from "domain →
code" to "domain → spec." But the loss is smaller,
because the spec is written in structured natural
language by the person who holds the knowledge, not
translated through an intermediary. And the loss is
visible — a spec can be reviewed by anyone who
understands the domain. Code cannot.

The software stops being a twice-translated
approximation of the domain. It becomes a
once-translated expression, reviewed by the people
who know the domain best.

---

## AI assists spec authoring, not just code generation

The same AI that generates code from specs can help
write the specs themselves. A non-technical contributor
does not need to know the frontmatter format, the
correct `implements` path, or the naming conventions.
They describe the behavior they want in natural
language, and the agent structures it into a valid spec
node — placing the frontmatter, suggesting the
`implements` target, formatting the sections, flagging
ambiguities.

This lowers the barrier to contribution further. The
contributor focuses on *what* the software should do.
The agent handles the *form* of the spec. The engineer
reviews the result — both the content and the
structure — and enriches where needed.

But accessibility is not sufficiency. Writing a spec
node that generates correct code requires judgment
that goes beyond domain knowledge: what level of
detail to prescribe, which edge cases to anticipate,
how to structure contracts so the agent makes the
right implementation choices. A compliance officer
knows the regulation — but knowing which aspects of
the regulation need to be explicit in the spec, and
which the agent will handle correctly from context,
is a skill that develops with experience.

The realistic model is collaborative authorship. The
domain expert contributes the knowledge. The engineer
— or the AI assistant — structures it into an
effective spec. Over time, as contributors gain
experience with what works and what doesn't, they
need less engineering support. But the gap between
"I know the domain" and "I can write a spec that
generates correct code" is real, and the methodology
should not pretend otherwise.

---

## The cost of change becomes constant

The software industry has long accepted that the cost
of fixing a defect grows the later it is discovered —
cheapest during design, expensive during development,
very expensive in production. The entire discipline of
quality engineering is built around "shift left": find
defects earlier, when they are still cheap to fix.

Code from Spec collapses this curve. There is no
separate "development phase" where design decisions
become expensive to reverse. Every change is a spec
change. Correcting a provisioning rule three months
after the initial implementation costs the same as
correcting it on day one: update the spec node,
regenerate the code. The accounting team that
discovers an error in reconciliation logic does not
file a bug for the engineering team to investigate,
prioritize, and fix. They correct the spec — or ask
for it to be corrected — and the code is regenerated.

The cost of change becomes constant. "Shift left"
becomes meaningless — not because defects don't
matter, but because it is always design. The spec
tree is always the artifact under revision. The code
is always derived.

---

## The spec as organizational asset

A spec tree that grows with the system is a different
kind of asset from anything that exists in software
organizations today.

It is not documentation. Documentation describes a
system that exists independently and drifts as the system
changes. The spec tree *is* the system — code is its
shadow. When the spec changes, the code changes. There
is no drift by construction.

It is not code. Code expresses mechanism. The spec tree
expresses intent, decisions, constraints, and the
rationale behind every behavior. It is legible to anyone
who understands the domain, regardless of technical
background.

It is not a knowledge base. Knowledge bases accumulate
information without structure. The spec tree is
structured by the system itself — every node is in
exactly the right place in the hierarchy, and its
position expresses its relationship to everything else.

What it is: a complete, versionable, executable
representation of organizational knowledge about the
system. Every decision recorded. Every constraint
traceable to its source. Every behavior attributable to
a spec node with an author and a version.

This asset compounds. A team that uses Code from Spec
for a year has a spec tree that reflects a year of
learning — every bug that was fixed, every edge case
that was discovered, every compliance requirement that
was added. The tree grows more precise as the
organization's understanding of the domain grows. The
software becomes more correct not because the engineers
got better, but because the domain knowledge got more
explicit.

---

## Auditability by construction

Every generated source file carries an artifact tag
linking it to the spec that produced it:
`code-from-spec: <logical-name>@<chain-hash>`. The
chain hash is a content-based fingerprint of the
entire chain — every ancestor, dependency, and
external file that contributed to the generation.
The git history of the spec directory is a complete
audit trail: who wrote each node, when it changed,
and what it said at every point in time.

In regulated environments — finance, healthcare,
government — this is compliance by construction. An
auditor can trace any behavior in the running system
back to a spec node, to the person who authored it,
to the version that introduced it. No reconstruction
needed. No forensic archaeology of code commits. The
lineage is always present and always current.

---

## The maturation of software

Software systems traditionally get harder to change over
time. Decisions made early — some good, some arbitrary,
some wrong — become load-bearing. The codebase
accumulates the residue of every compromise, every
shortcut, every misunderstanding of the domain. Changing
fundamental behavior requires understanding an
archaeology of previous decisions.

Code from Spec inverts this. The spec tree matures as
the organization's understanding matures. When a
fundamental understanding changes — a new interpretation
of a regulation, a revised business model, a corrected
domain concept — the change is made in the tree at the
right level of abstraction, and the impact propagates
mechanically to the affected leaves. The code is
regenerated. The system reflects the current
understanding, not the historical one.

The spec tree is the accumulation of organizational
learning. It does not carry the residue of past
mistakes in the way code does — mistakes are corrected
at the source, and the correction propagates. The system
does not get harder to change as it matures; it gets
easier, because the spec becomes more precise and the
change impact becomes more predictable.

---

## How this reshapes the organization

Code from Spec is not just a technical methodology. It
changes the economics and incentive structures of how
a company builds software.

### The spec tree is capital, not overhead

Today, specification is treated as a cost — time spent
documenting instead of "delivering." In Code from Spec,
the spec tree is the primary productive asset. It is the
thing that generates value. Code is a derived artifact.
This inverts the mental accounting: investing in specs
is investing in the product, not in bureaucracy.

### Reduced dependency on individuals

The bus factor of a traditional software company is the
engineer who knows how the system works. With a spec
tree, the knowledge is in the tree, not in someone's
head. The company is less vulnerable to turnover. This
has real economic value — it reduces operational risk,
lowers the cost of attrition, and makes hiring less
urgent.

### The spec as organizational contract

Between teams, the spec becomes the contract. The
payments team does not need to meet with the accounting
team to "align" — both look at the spec tree. Changes
are versioned. Impact is visible before code changes.
Ambiguities are explicit, not discovered during
integration. This reduces coordination cost, which in
large organizations is the dominant cost.

### Faster onboarding

A new team member reads the spec tree and understands
the system — its purpose, its architecture, its
constraints, its decisions. They don't need weeks
reading code and asking colleagues. The spec tree is
the onboarding. This directly impacts the cost of
growing the team and the time to productivity.

### Governance without bureaucracy

In large organizations, any structured process can be
captured by bureaucracy. "Three approvals needed to
create a node." "Every node requires compliance review
before merge." The antidote is to treat the spec tree
as a tool for empowerment, not control. Guard nodes
protect without approving — protection is automatic,
not procedural. The tree enforces quality structurally,
not politically.

But compliance is real. Regulated industries cannot
deploy without governance. The solution is not to
eliminate review — it is to place it where it has the
highest value and lowest friction.

**Layered governance through branches.** A `main`
branch is where iteration happens. Anyone can
contribute. Review is technical and fast. A `prod`
(or `release`) branch is the governance gate. A PR
from main to prod requires approval from stakeholders:
compliance, infosec, product, legal — whoever is
relevant. This PR is about the spec tree, not about
code. The reviewers read structured natural language,
not implementation details. They approve what they
understand.

This separates velocity from rigor. The team iterates
at full speed on main. Governance happens at deploy
time, on a diff the governance team can actually read.

---

## The transition: from full review to trust

Adopting Code from Spec does not mean immediately
trusting AI-generated code. Trust is built through
evidence, not optimism.

**Phase 1: Full review.** Humans review specs and
generated code. Every regeneration is inspected.
Variability analysis identifies where the agent
deviates. Specs are tightened. This is where the
organization builds confidence in the methodology and
discovers the agent's failure modes.

**Phase 2: Sampling.** Humans review specs thoroughly
but examine generated code by sampling. Tests and the
enforcement tool provide confidence. Focus shifts to
new or complex leaves, not routine regenerations.

**Phase 3: Spec review only.** Humans review specs.
Code is verified by tests, CI, and enforcement tooling.
Humans examine code only when a test fails or for
critical financial operations.

**Phase 4: Governance gate.** Humans review specs only
at the production deployment boundary (the PR from main
to prod). Everything else is automated. Guard nodes
protect. Tests verify. The human is the final authority
on intent, not on implementation.

Each phase transition is earned by evidence: fewer
agent errors, more comprehensive tests, tighter specs,
better enforcement tooling. The organization moves at
its own pace. Skipping phases is the only mistake.

Trust can also regress. A serious bug in production
caused by generated code can — and should — make the
team return to a previous phase. This is the
methodology working as intended: evidence drives the
transition in both directions. The phases are not a
ladder to climb but a dial to adjust.

## The return to engineering

The word "engineering" implies rigor: analysis of
requirements, design of solutions, specification of
behavior, verification of correctness. Software
engineering adopted this name but, under the pressure of
economic constraints, abandoned the practice. The
bottleneck was never typing code — it was always knowing
what to type. But because code generation was expensive,
the industry optimized for coding speed and called it
engineering.

Code from Spec restores the practice. The engineer's job
is analysis and design: understanding the domain,
structuring the spec tree, placing guard nodes, resolving
ambiguities, reviewing contributions from domain experts.
The agent types. The engineer thinks.

This is not a demotion of engineering. It is a return to
what engineering was always supposed to be — and now can
be, because the constraint that prevented it has been
removed.

The engineer is not hired to write code. The engineer is
hired because they are intelligent people who solve
complex problems. Writing code was the mechanism
available to exercise that role — it was never the role
itself. Code from Spec removes the confusion between the
two. What remains is the work that always mattered.

The organizations that recognize this shift early will
build systems that are more correct, more compliant, more
auditable, and easier to change than anything built with
traditional methods. Not because their engineers are
better, but because their entire organization is now
capable of contributing to the software that runs their
business.

## The endgame: code as a build artifact

If code is derived from specs, it does not need to be
versioned. It is a build artifact — like a compiled
binary, generated from source and reproducible from it.

Today, repositories contain both specs and generated
code. This is a transitional state. It exists because
the methodology is young, trust is still being built,
and teams need to inspect the generated output. But it
creates friction: merge conflicts in generated files,
noisy diffs from regeneration, code review of derived
artifacts that adds cost without adding insight.

The logical conclusion is a repository that contains
only the spec tree, external dependencies, and test
specs. The CI pipeline receives the specs, dispatches
agents to generate the code, runs the tests, and
deploys. Code is ephemeral — generated, verified, and
discarded. No one reviews it. No one merges it. No one
versions it.

Imagine the workflow: a compliance officer updates a
regulatory constraint. A product manager adds a
business rule. An engineer refines a concurrency
pattern. Each commits to the spec tree. The CI
pipeline generates the code, runs the tests, and
deploys. No one wrote code. No one reviewed code.
No one merged code. The entire team worked in specs
— the artifact they all understand — and the
software took care of itself.

The other half of this vision is who participates.
Today, contributing to software requires programming
skill — or at minimum, the ability to describe what
you want precisely enough for a programmer to
translate. The spec tree lowers this barrier
progressively. As AI improves at helping non-technical
contributors structure their knowledge into specs, as
guard nodes make it safer for anyone to contribute
without breaking invariants, as the tooling becomes
more accessible — the circle of contributors widens.
The accountant who writes the reconciliation rules.
The compliance officer who maintains the regulatory
constraints. The operations manager who specifies the
SLA requirements. Each contributing directly to the
software that runs their part of the business.

These are the two utopias that Code from Spec
pursues: a world where the spec tree is the only
artifact that matters, and a world where anyone in
the organization can contribute to it. Neither may
be fully realized. But every step toward them — more
precise specs, better test coverage, more reliable
agents, more accessible tooling — makes the
methodology more valuable. The utopias are the
direction, not the destination. Every decision in the
methodology asks: does this move us closer?

## The spec tree as context management

AI agents have a fundamental constraint: a finite context
window. No matter how large it becomes, a non-trivial
system will always contain more knowledge than fits in a
single prompt. The practical question is not whether the
agent can hold the entire system in context — it cannot —
but how the right context reaches the agent at the right
time.

In a traditional AI-assisted workflow, the agent reads
source files, grep results, and conversation history to
assemble context. This is ad hoc and fragile. The agent
does not know what it does not know. It reads what it
finds, infers what it can, and guesses the rest. Each
session starts from scratch — the previous session's
understanding is lost, and the agent must rediscover
context by reading code.

Code is a poor context accumulator. It records mechanism,
not intent. When an agent reads a function, it sees what
the function does — not why it does it that way, what
alternatives were considered, what constraints it
respects, or what other parts of the system depend on its
behavior. The agent reconstructs these things by reading
more code, which provides more mechanism and less intent.
Context assembled from code is voluminous but shallow.

The spec tree inverts this. Every node in the tree is a
unit of explicit context — intent, constraints, decisions,
interfaces. The `depends_on` mechanism is simultaneously a
dependency declaration (for staleness tracking) and a
context declaration (for generation). When a generation
subagent receives a chain, it receives exactly the context
it needs: the ancestors' constraints, the dependencies'
interfaces, the external references, the target's spec.
Nothing more, nothing less.

This is context management by construction, not by effort.
The author of a spec node does not think about "what
context will the agent need." They declare dependencies
because the node genuinely depends on them. The context
assembly follows automatically. As the tree grows, adding
hundreds of new nodes does not inflate the context for
existing nodes — each node's chain includes only what it
declared. The system scales without degrading context
quality.

More importantly, the spec tree accumulates context across
sessions. In a traditional workflow, a productive
four-hour session with an AI produces code changes and
(maybe) some comments. The next session starts over — the
agent reads the code and tries to reconstruct what
happened. The context from the previous session is gone.

In Code from Spec, a productive session produces spec
changes. Those changes are the context. The next session
— with the same agent or a different one — picks up the
spec tree as it stands. Every decision made in every
previous session is present in the tree, structured and
accessible. The context compounds across sessions, across
contributors, across time. The spec tree is the
organization's context, externalized and versioned.

This has a subtle but profound implication: the spec tree
can represent more knowledge than any single context
window can hold, while still providing each agent
invocation with precisely the context it needs. The total
knowledge in the tree is unbounded. The context per
generation is bounded and curated. This is how Code from
Spec scales beyond the limits of any individual AI model.

---

## Implicit knowledge is invisible knowledge

AI agents do not generalize across invocations. A pattern
that worked in one generation does not carry over to the
next. Each subagent starts fresh, with only the chain as
input. Knowledge that is not in the chain does not exist
for the agent.

This has a practical consequence that teams discover
quickly: every pattern, convention, or technique that
should be followed must be explicit in the spec tree. If
it is not written down, it will not be followed
consistently.

Consider a concrete example. A project uses `PathCfs`
values (paths relative to the project root) throughout
its codebase. Tests that create temporary files must
change the working directory to the temp directory before
creating files, so that `PathCfs` resolution works
correctly. This pattern — call it `testChdir` — is
simple and obvious to a human who has seen it once. But
a generation subagent that has not seen it will invent
a different approach: computing relative paths with
`filepath.Rel`, which fails on Windows when the temp
directory is on a different drive than the project.

If the `testChdir` pattern is documented in a spec node
that tests inherit (via ancestor chain), every test
generation receives it and follows it. If it is not
documented — even if it exists in previously generated
test files — the next generation may or may not discover
it, depending on what the agent infers from the code in
its chain.

The rule is absolute: if the agent should know it, the
tree must say it. Comments in generated code, patterns
in existing implementations, conventions discussed in
chat sessions — none of these survive regeneration unless
they are migrated to the spec tree. This is the same
principle as the "tests as accumulated knowledge" section
applied more broadly: all knowledge that matters must
live in the tree, not in derived artifacts.

This is not a burden — it is the methodology's core
value proposition. Every piece of knowledge migrated to
the tree is knowledge that will never be lost, never be
re-discovered, never be implemented inconsistently. The
cost is writing it down once. The return is consistency
across every generation, every session, every
contributor, forever.

## Caveats

### AI is the weakest link

The methodology depends on AI agents, but agents are the
least reliable component. They hallucinate, ignore
instructions, read files they shouldn't, invent paths
that don't exist, and rationalize skipping rules they were
explicitly told to follow. The structural guardrails —
small scope, complete context, tests, build verification
— exist precisely because the agent cannot be trusted on
its own.

This is not a temporary limitation waiting for better
models. It is a design assumption. The methodology is
built to produce correct results even when the agent
makes mistakes, by ensuring that mistakes are caught
mechanically. Trust the framework, not the agent.

### The organizational shift is political, not automatic

The rationale describes compliance officers writing spec
nodes and domain experts contributing directly. This is
technically possible but organizationally hard. It
requires people to change how they work, adopt unfamiliar
tools, and take ownership of artifacts they've never owned
before.

The methodology enables this shift. It does not cause it.
The cause is leadership, training, and sustained cultural
investment. Teams that adopt Code from Spec expecting the
organizational benefits to emerge automatically will be
disappointed. The spec tree is the foundation; the
organizational transformation is built on top of it,
deliberately.

### Where Code from Spec is not the right approach

Not every system benefits from this methodology.

- **Prototypes and throwaway code.** If the code will be
  discarded, investing in a spec tree is waste.
- **Trivial systems.** If the spec tree would be more
  complex than the code, the overhead is not justified.
- **Rapidly evolving domains.** If the domain changes
  faster than the spec tree can keep up, the tree becomes
  a burden rather than an asset. However, the spec tree
  itself can evolve rapidly — renaming, reorganizing,
  and changing semantics across dozens of nodes — as long
  as the staleness tracking propagates changes correctly.
  The constraint is not rate of change but whether the
  team can keep specs precise enough for reliable
  generation between resyncs.

Code from Spec is designed for systems that must be
correct, auditable, and maintainable over time — systems
where the cost of getting it wrong exceeds the cost of
specifying it precisely.

---

## Precision is not documentation

The word "specification" suggests a document. In
practice, a spec node is a machine component — a part
that must fit precisely with every other part. The
level of detail required goes far beyond what
"documentation" evokes.

In real usage, precision means: every error has a
formal name (PascalCase, not prose). Every function
name is chosen once and used identically from the
functional spec through the interface through the
implementation through the tests. Every record field
has an explicit type — not "a string" but "a list of
strings, one per line as returned by the file reader."
Every test case prescribes not just the expected
outcome but the exact setup that produces it.

When a spec says "file unreadable," different
generation agents produce different sentinel names,
different wrapping patterns, different test assertions.
When a spec says `FileUnreadable`, every agent produces
`ErrFileUnreadable`. The difference between prose and
formal names is the difference between approximate and
exact generation.

This precision is expensive to achieve. A single error
naming convention required updating 16 functional nodes,
14 interface nodes, and every test spec. But the cost
is paid once. Every subsequent regeneration benefits —
not just the next one, but every one, forever.

---

## Regeneration from scratch as validation

The ultimate test of a spec tree is not whether it
generates correct code once. It is whether it generates
correct code after every artifact is deleted and
regenerated from scratch.

This practice — delete all generated files, regenerate
everything in dependency order — is the definitive
proof that the spec tree is the real asset and the code
is a derived artifact. If the regeneration produces a
working system, the specs are sufficient. If it does
not, the failures point directly to spec gaps.

In practice, a mature spec tree produces 95%+ correct
artifacts on full regeneration. The failures are not
random — each one traces to a specific place where the
spec was silent or ambiguous. Fix the spec, regenerate,
and the gap is closed permanently.

Teams should perform full regeneration periodically —
not as a routine operation, but as a health check. It
reveals accumulated drift: conventions that exist in
code but not in specs, patterns that agents follow by
accident rather than by instruction, assumptions that
work today but will break on the next regeneration.

---

## The cost of change is constant per decision

The rationale states that the cost of change becomes
constant. This is true per decision — changing a
business rule costs the same whether it is day one or
year three. But the total cost is proportional to the
number of dependents.

Changing a fundamental type (e.g., a record field from
`string` to `list of string`) cascades to every
component that reads that field: implementations,
tests, hash computations, context assembly. In a real
project, this touched 40+ files. But every change at
every cascade point was mechanical — no creative
judgment required. The blast radius was large in files
touched, small in decisions needed.

This is the key distinction: in code, cascading changes
require judgment at every point ("does this caller need
to handle the new type differently?"). In a spec tree,
cascading changes are mechanical ("this node reads that
field, regenerate it"). The cost scales with the tree's
size but not with the tree's complexity.

Tools that automate cascading — rename operations,
bulk regeneration, dependency-ordered processing — make
this cost negligible in practice.

## AI as spec co-author

The rationale's section on AI-assisted spec authoring
understates what happens in practice. AI does not just
help with formatting and structure. It participates in
every phase of spec development:

- **Review**: AI identifies missing error cases,
  inconsistent naming, undocumented edge cases,
  redundant dependencies. It catches mechanical
  problems that humans overlook.
- **Design**: AI proposes alternatives — function
  names, record structures, grouping strategies. The
  human evaluates and decides.
- **Diagnosis**: when generated code fails tests, AI
  traces the failure to the spec gap. It identifies
  which spec node is responsible and what needs to
  change.

But AI does not make design decisions. In every session,
the pattern is consistent: AI proposes, human disposes.
The human asks "should this feature exist?" — a question
AI cannot answer because it requires understanding the
users, the economics, and the long-term vision. The
human asks "would a newcomer understand this structure?"
— a question AI cannot answer because it requires
judgment about cognitive load, not just logical
consistency.

The most productive model is collaborative authorship
where the AI handles volume (reviewing every node,
checking every reference, generating every artifact) and
the human handles judgment (naming, organization,
feature scope, simplification). Neither is sufficient
alone. Together, they produce specs that are both
comprehensive and coherent.
